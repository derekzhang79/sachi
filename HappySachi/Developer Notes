This Developer Notes file is to make notes (for myself or others who may look at the project) on improvements that should be made.
I know that there are far too many lines of code in the app. Sorry. Still learning.
If I were able to spend some more time on the project to clean it up, the first thing I'd do is create a Master Class for all the ViewControllers. They all share some commom components like the mute button.
Because I didn't write the program like that from the beginning, there is a significant amount of copy-paste programming here, and I'd like to eliminate that. 
Another note is to crop audio files. There is significant "Dead Air" at the end of these files, which may cause confusion for the user.
